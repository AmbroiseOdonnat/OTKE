# Optimal Transport Kernel Embedding for Sets
Study of [A Trainable Optimal Transport Embedding for Feature Aggregation and its Relationship to Attention](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ZK6vTvb84s) for the course of Computational Optimal Transport Project, Master MVA 2022.

## Abstract
In our work, we show that the error on the 2-Wasserstein
distance approximation obtained via the proposed embedding decreases with the
number of points in reference. We propose in the same fashion an approximation
of the p-Wasserstein distance and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a
proxy for the 1-Wasserstein distance-based loss function in Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Networks. Finally, we illustrate the benefits and robustness of the
optimal transport kernel embedding on a logistic classification task with synthetic
distributions.
